# datapainter

TUI for creating two-dimensional datasets and saving them into a SQLite database

# UI Design

You can cursor around and put an X or an O anywhere on a 2D grid which gets saved to a 
SQLite database

On screen you have something that looks like this:


```
[Database filename]    [Database tablename] [Total points=___, x=__,o=__,]
[Target column name]   x = [_______]  o = [_________]

    |                                                                                      |

    |                                                                                      |

 0 --                                                                                      |

```

You move around the edit area with cursor arrows. Arrow keys move cursor within viewport.
If cursor would go beyond edge AND there is more valid range available: shift viewport.
If the first column is already at the pre-defined x minimum, nothing happens: otherwise
it shifts the viewport.

TAB gets you to the other places (e.g. valid x-ranges, quit, undo and save. u, q and s
are short cuts.

Space erases any points under the cursor. Multiple points can exist at the exact same (x,y)
coordinates (duplicates are allowed). A point is considered "under the cursor" if it rounds to
the exact same screen cell coordinates as the cursor position. Points on screen can only be an
approximation of the values in the dataset. If there are several x points under the cursor,
it is shown as an X. If there are several o points, they are shown as an O. If there are
both x and o points, it is shown as a #.

Pressing x creates an x point. Pressing X (shift-X) makes existing o points under the 
cursor into xs.

Pressing o creates an o point. Pressing O (shift-o) makes existing x points under the
cursor into os.

Pressing g flips all points individually under the cursor: if it was an o, it's now an x and
vice versa. Each point flips independently to its opposite type.

Pressing the # key switches the system into tabular view mode, which is a three
column TUI. (The x column, the y column and the target column). The table view is fully
editable - users can add, edit, and delete rows directly. All changes are recorded in the
unsaved_changes table, just like viewport edits. Filter and sort can be applied while editing.

By default it has a filter on which limits the points shown. When switching into table mode,
the filter is set to whatever the viewport was showing. When switching from tabular mode to
viewport mode, it sets the viewport to tightly fit all filtered/visible rows.

**Filter syntax:** SQL WHERE clause, e.g., `x BETWEEN ? AND ? AND y BETWEEN ? AND ?`. Default
filter when entering table mode is the current viewport bounds. Filter can be edited by user
while in table mode.


# CLI arguments

It can be launched with or without CLI arguments. The args are:
  - --x-axis-name
  - --y-axis-name
  - --database
  - --table
  - --target-column-name
  - --x-meaning
  - --o-meaning
  - --min-x
  - --max-x
  - --min-y
  - --max-y
  

If it is just given the database filename, it looks for a tablename called `metadata`. If it finds
it, then it will have rows containing table/axis name/meanings. It provides a dialog box to select
among them (with an option to copy to a new table, create a blank table, and delete or rename a table).
If --database and --table are given, then it looks for metadata to fill in the rest of
the information. If there is no metadata available for a new table, it prompts for the
x-axis name, y-axis name, target name, etc.

**CLI Conflict Resolution:** If there is ANY discrepancy between CLI arguments and existing metadata,
the program will ERROR and refuse to start. The error message will clearly show the conflict and
suggest resolution (remove the conflicting CLI flag, or use a different table name).

**Target Column Storage:** The target column stores the actual meaning values (from --x-meaning and
--o-meaning), NOT the literal characters 'x' and 'o'. For example, if --x-meaning="cat" and
--o-meaning="dog", the target column contains "cat" or "dog". The characters 'x' and 'o' are display
symbols only, used in the UI.

If there is no metadata table, it creates it. If there is no table called `unsaved_changes` it creates
that too.

If it has to create a data table, it makes sure that there are indexes on the x-axis column, the y-axis
column and the target column.

## Database Schema

**Data table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} (
  id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  x       REAL NOT NULL,
  y       REAL NOT NULL,
  target  TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS {table}_xy      ON {table}(x, y);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS {table}_target  ON {table}(target);
```

**Metadata table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metadata (
  table_name        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  x_axis_name       TEXT NOT NULL,
  y_axis_name       TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_col_name   TEXT NOT NULL,
  x_meaning         TEXT NOT NULL,
  o_meaning         TEXT NOT NULL,
  valid_x_min       REAL,
  valid_x_max       REAL,
  valid_y_min       REAL,
  valid_y_max       REAL,
  show_zero_bars    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Unsaved changes table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS unsaved_changes (
  id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name    TEXT NOT NULL,
  action        TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('insert','delete','update','meta')),
  -- For insert/delete/update actions:
  data_id       INTEGER,  -- the id in the data table (null for insert before save)
  x             REAL,
  y             REAL,
  old_target    TEXT,
  new_target    TEXT,
  -- For meta actions:
  meta_field    TEXT,
  old_value     TEXT,
  new_value     TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS uc_table ON unsaved_changes(table_name, id);
```

# Non-interactive mode

These don't start up the TUI.
  - --create-table (+ args for the metadata)
  - --rename-table
  - --copy-table
  - --delete-table
  - --list-tables
  - --show-metadata
  - --add-point
  - --delete-point
  - --to-csv
  - --key-stroke-at-point (x,y) [key] -- pretend that we've pressed that key at those coordinates

Then there are some args which will be useful for testing. They start the TUI
  - --dump-screen = non-interactive mode, usually paired with an action like key-stroke-at-point
  - --dump-edit-area-contents  = ditto, but just show the edit area, not the whole screen


# User interface options

  - --show-zero-bars = Controls display of Cartesian axes (zero bars). Do NOT automatically show
    zero axes just because zero is in the viewport. Only show if --show-zero-bars is provided via
    CLI OR show_zero_bars=1 in the metadata table. Default is OFF (show_zero_bars=0). When enabled
    and x=0 is in viewport: draw vertical line at x=0. When enabled and y=0 is in viewport: draw
    horizontal line at y=0. Use distinct characters (e.g., '|' for y-axis, '-' or 'â”€' for x-axis)
    differentiated from grid lines.
  - --override-screen-height and --override-screen-width -- by default it detects the terminal size
  (and rescales if the terminal is resized) This is useful for testing as well as screen ergonomics. If the
  override is bigger than the screen and we aren't just dumping output, exit with an error message
  - --start-tabular = start with the tabular view instead

# Undo/Redo mechanism

CLI arguments
 - --clear-undo-log (tablename)
 - --clear-all-undo-log (clears all tables' unsaved changes)
 - --commit-unsaved-changes (tablename)
 - --list-unsaved-changes

The data displayed on screen is a combination of whatever was in the relevant data table, and whatever is
stored in the `unsaved_changes` table. Point changes get added and deleted by appending to the `unsaved_changes`
table. Pressing the save button commits those changes into the relevant table.

The `unsaved_changes` table also tracks changes to the meaning of x and o values in the target column,
and the min and max x and y values.

**Undo and Redo:** The 'u' key undoes the last action. After undoing one or more actions, redo becomes
available. Making any new edit clears the redo stack. Note: Only single-key shortcuts are supported
(u for undo), not Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y.

**Save Behavior:** Saving commits all unapplied events from unsaved_changes to the main data table
in a single transaction, then clears or marks unsaved_changes as applied. The program continues
running after save - it does NOT exit. The user can continue editing after saving.

# Zoom

The default viewport behavior depends on whether the table is empty or has data:

**Empty table (no data points):**
- If valid ranges are set (via --min-x, --max-x, --min-y, --max-y or in metadata): use those as viewport
- Otherwise: default to (-1, 1, -1, 1)

**Table with existing data:**
- Fit viewport to data bounds with 10% padding on each side
- Formula: viewport_min = data_min - 0.1 * (data_max - data_min)
- Formula: viewport_max = data_max + 0.1 * (data_max - data_min)
- If --initial-viewport-range (xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh) is provided via CLI, that overrides the auto-fit

**Valid ranges enforcement:**
- Valid x/y ranges (--min-x, --max-x, --min-y, --max-y) are HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Attempting to create a point outside the valid ranges is rejected
- The UI should prevent cursor movement or point creation beyond these boundaries
- Out-of-range areas can be shown with '!' wall characters

There is also an option - --zoom-in / --zoom-out ... just for testing, and used in conjunction with the 
   CLI --list-x-axis-marks and --list-y-axis-marks ... this causes a zoom event to happen and we can confirm 
   that the resulting axis marks for a screen that size would be handled correctly.

The internal zoom state consists of:
 - the minimum and maximum numbers (in the x and y range) that we have to keep visible
 - the decimal place that we are showing major tick marks for. 
     0 means that we are showing integer major tick marks.
     1 means that we are showing tick marks for every 10
     -1 means that we are showing tick marks for every 0.1
     It is simply the base 10 log of the range in that axis
 - the number of spaces on screen in the viewport in each axis
 - how many spaces on screen will be needed for each tick mark (not counting the space after it)
 - (therefore) how many characters on screen the major tick marks can be visible on screen
 - (therefore) whether there is room in the gaps between major tick marks for half minor tick marks 
   (e.g. at 0.05 when the tick marks are at 0.1 steps) and tenth minor tick marks (at 0.01 when the 
   major ticks are at 0.1)

When the user zooms in, each space on screen halves in data space; when they zoom out, it's
double. Zoom in/out is centered on the current cursor coordinates (not the screen center).

There are situations where there will be spaces on screen below the minimum and maximum x values.
These are shown by a wall of ! characters.

# Study mode

If invoked with --database, --table and --study it will:

**Purpose:** Import an existing three-column table and configure it for datapainter.

**Validation (exits with error if any fail):**
- Check if metadata already exists for that table â†’ ERROR if exists
- Validate exactly 3 columns exist
- Validate 2 columns are REAL type
- Validate the third column has exactly 2 distinct values
- Validate no nulls in any column

**Interactive configuration:**
- Prompt: Which distinct value should be displayed as 'x' and which as 'o'?
- Prompt: Which column is the x-axis and which is the y-axis?
- Suggest: minimum x and y and maximum x and y based on the dataset
- Allow: user to override suggested min/max values

**Result:** Creates metadata entry for the table, making it ready for use with datapainter.

# Random init

Options for random init:
 - --random-count = how many points to create
 - --random-target = what target value to use for those random points
 - --mean-x, --mean-y where to centre the points
 - --normal-x and --normal-y (together with --std-x, --std-y) draw from a normal distribution
 - --uniform-x and --uniform-y (together with --range-x, --range-y) draw from a uniform distribution of width `range`

Note that you would normally run random init twice, once for the "x" and once for the "o" outputs.
