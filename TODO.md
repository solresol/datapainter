## Notes

- This TODO follows TDD principles: write test first, then implementation
- Tasks are ordered to build incrementally (foundation → features → polish)
- Each checkbox represents a discrete, testable unit of work
- Phase numbers suggest logical grouping, but some phases can run in parallel
- Database layer must be solid before building UI on top
- Non-interactive commands can be built alongside UI features
- Integration testing comes after individual features are complete
