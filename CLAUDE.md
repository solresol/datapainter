- Development is done in C++
- Features are added via red-green TDD

## Project Planning

- TODO.md contains the comprehensive implementation plan organized in 20 phases
- The TODO list follows TDD principles: write tests first, then implementation
- Tasks are ordered to build incrementally from foundation (database layer) through features to polish
- Each checkbox in TODO.md represents a discrete, testable unit of work
- Phases are logical groupings; some can be worked on in parallel
- The database layer (Phase 1) must be solid before building UI features on top
- Current project status: Greenfield (no code exists yet)
